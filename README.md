# Object-Oriented Event Emitter

## For those who miss the point with event emitters

It's written in **TypeScript** so it should be intuitively clear for one who's common with **JS**, otherwise you can visit
[its homepage](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Tutorial) for help.

## In case you wish to play with it
1. Install build dependencies with `npm i`
2. Install **gulp** with `npm i -g gulp` (`sudo` may be needed)
3. Compile with `gulp`

You can optionally specify a template to wrap the resulting code with `--wrap`. Omitting the `--wrap` option is equal to
`gulp --wrap="var ooee = function() {<%= contents %>return OOEEmitter;}();"`, where `<%= contents %>` specify the place
for the code generated by the `typescript` compiler.
